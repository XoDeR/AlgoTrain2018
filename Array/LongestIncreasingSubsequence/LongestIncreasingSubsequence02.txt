How to print LIS?

To make things simpler, we can keep in the S, not the actual integers, but their indices in the set. That is we do not keep {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}, but keep {4, 5, 3, 7, 8} since arr[4] = 1, arr[5] = 2, arr[3] = 4, arr[7] = 5 and arr[8] = 8.

To reconstruct the actual LIS we have to use a parent array. Let parent[i] be the predecessor of element with index i in the LIS ending at element with index i. If we update properly the parent array, the actual LIS is:

    arr[S[lastElementOfS]],
    arr[parent[S[lastElementOfS]]],
    arr[parent[parent[S[lastElementOfS]]]],
         ………………………………….
 

Below solution stores both actual integers and their indices in the set for easier implementation

Output: 

LIS is 2 3 4 5 8

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(nlog(n)) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(n).
