The longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequenceâ€™s elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.

 

For example, consider subsequence {0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15}

The Longest increasing subsequence is {0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15}

This subsequence has length 6; the input sequence has no 7-member increasing subsequences. The longest increasing subsequence in this example is not unique: for instance,

    {0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15} or
    {0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15}

are other increasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.
