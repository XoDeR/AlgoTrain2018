We can easily solve this problem in linear time using kadane’s algorithm. The idea is to maintain maximum (positive sum) sub-array “ending” at each index of the given array. This subarray is either empty (in which case its sum is zero) or consists of one more element than the maximum subarray ending at the previous index.

Output: 

The sum of contiguous sub-array with the largest sum is 6

 
The time complexity of above solution is O(n) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(1).
