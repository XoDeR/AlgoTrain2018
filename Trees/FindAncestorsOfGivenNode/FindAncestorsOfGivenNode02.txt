Iterative solution

The idea is to main a map to store parent node information of all nodes present in the tree. Then we do a iterative pre-order traversal of the tree, and set parent pointer of each node. Finally, we print ancestors of given key by using parent map.

The time complexity of above solution is O(n) and auxiliary space used by the program is O(n).
