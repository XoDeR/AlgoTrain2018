Given a binary tree and a node in it, write an efficient algorithm to find its next node in same level as given node.

 


For example, consider below binary tree

         1
       /   \
      2     3
     / \     \
    4   5     6
             / \
            7   8

Next node of 2 is 3
Next node of 5 is 6
Next node of 7 is 8
Next node of 8 is null
