We can also solve this problem by using constant auxiliary space and in linear time. The idea is to traverse the tree in preorder fashion and search for the given node. Once the given node is found, we mark its level number. Then the first node encountered at same level is the next right node.

The time complexity of above solution is O(n) and need O(h) extra space for the call stack where h is the height of the tree.
