Merge Sort Performance:
 
Worst case time complexity of merge sort is O(nlog(n)). The recurrence relation is

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn = O(nlog(n))

The recurrence basically summaries merge sort algorithm â€“ Sort two lists of half the size of the original list, and add the n steps taken to merge the resulting two lists.

Auxiliary space required by it is O(n).
