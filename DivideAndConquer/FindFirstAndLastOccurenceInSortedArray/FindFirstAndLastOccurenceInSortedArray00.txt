Given a sorted array of integers, find index of first or last occurrence of a given number. If the element is not found in the array, report that as well.

For example,

Input: 
arr = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
target = 5

Output: 
First occurrence of element 5 is found at index 1
Last occurrence of element 5 is found at index 3

Input: 
arr = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]
target = 4

Output: 
Element not found in the array

A simple solution would be to run a linear search on the array and return first or last occurrence of the given element. The problem with this approach is that its worst case time complexity is O(n). This solution also do not take advantage of the fact that the input is sorted. We can easily solve this problem in O(log(n)) time. The idea is to modify the binary search algorithm to solve this problem.
